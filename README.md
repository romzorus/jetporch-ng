# Context

On 23th december 2023, Michael DeHaan sent a newsletter ("Discontinuing Jet") in which he announced that he has decided to not work on Jet any more. This repository has been created by me as a way to continue to explore Rust and learn from this great project, even if it doesn't lead anywhere. It was forked from [here](https://github.com/jetporch/jetporch) and renamed **my-custom-jetporch** in order to avoid confusion with the original project. Even if the basecode is 100% jetporch at the beginning, I intend to make it evolve without restriction, merge branches...etc in an opinionated way, which can't be done with only a fork.

**Feel free to send comments and contributions if you feel like it !**
