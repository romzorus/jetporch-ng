# Context

On 23th december 2023, Michael DeHaan sent a newsletter ("Discontinuing Jet") in which he announced that he has decided to not work on Jet any more. This repository has been created by me as a way to continue to explore Rust and learn from this great project, even if it doesn't lead anywhere. It was forked from [here](https://github.com/jetporch/jetporch) and renamed "jetporch-ng" in order to avoid confusion with the original project. Even if the basecode is 100% jetporch at the beginning, I intend to make it evolve without restriction, merge branches...etc which can't be done with only a fork so, at some point, it won't really be the same project anymore. Maybe some completely different repo name will be necessary then.

Feel free to send comments and contributions if you feel like it.
